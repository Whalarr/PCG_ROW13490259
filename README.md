Procedurally Generated Space diorama made in Unity with demo mp4

Built using Unity C#

Made during a module on procedural content generation at univeristy themed around a "space battle".
I opted to create an intense firefight scene occuring both on the ground amongst a ruined city as well
as in the atmosphere above. Taking inspiration from the warhammer 40K universe I produced procedurally generated
modular space ships spawned upon a hexmap as featured in the warhammer armada game series as well
as using the height values from a procedurally generated heightmap to dictate the placement of generated
buildings within the ruined city. The city itself features randomised squads of troops that occupy
the empty tiles and fire shots at one another from across the city.

The project was built using unity and an executable will be available to download and play. The executable
will display the generation at work and use a camera following a path to display the 
generated space scene.
